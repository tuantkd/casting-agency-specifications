# Casting Agency API
I am in this specific industry where such a tool will help the people do their job efficiently
I developed this project to make use of the knowledge you acquired in this nanodegree and hence gain confidence in these skills.
I wanted to contribute something to the open-source community by building this tool.
## Capstone Project for Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree

Render Link: https://render-deployment-example-o0wa.onrender.com

While running locally: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.10

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python).

#### Virtual Enviornment

Recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

## Running the server

Before running the application locally, make the following changes in the `app.py` file in root directory:

- Replace the following import statements
  ```
    from database.models import db_drop_and_create_all, setup_db, Actor, Movie
    from auth.auth import AuthError, requires_auth
  ```
  with
  ```
    from .database.models import db_drop_and_create_all, setup_db, Actor, Movie
    from .auth.auth import AuthError, requires_auth
  ```
- Also, uncomment the line `db_drop_and_create_all()` on the initial run to setup the required tables in the database.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=<database-connection-url>
#On Linux : export
export FLASK_APP=app.py
#On Windows : set
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --reload
```

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py` directs flask to use the `app.py` file to find the application.

Using the `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## API Reference

## Getting Started

Base URL: This application can be run locally. The hosted version is at `https://render-deployment-example-o0wa.onrender.com`.

Authentication: This application requires authentication to perform various actions. All the endpoints require
various permissions, except the root (or health) endpoint, that are passed via the `Bearer` token.

The application has three different types of roles:

- User
  - can only view the list of artist and movies and can view complete information for any actor or movie
  - has `get:actors, get:actors-info, get:movies, get:movies-info` permissions
- Manager
  - can perform all the actions that `User` can
  - can also create an actor and movie and also update respective information
  - has `patch:actor, patch:movie, post:actor, post:movie` permissions in addition to all the permissions that `User` role has
- Admin
  - can perform all the actions that `Manager` can
  - can also delete an actor or a movie
  - has `delete:actor, delete:movie` permissions in addition to all the permissions that `Manager` role has

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "error": 404,
    "message": "The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.",
    "success": false
}
```

The API will return the following errors based on how the request fails:

- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Testing

For testing the backend, run the following commands (in the exact order):

```
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql capstone_test < casting.sql
python test.py
```

Alternate way: Create the db `capstone_test` using PgAdmin and copy the contents of casting.sql and paste them
in Query tool in PgAdmin and create the db table with records. Then, run the command `python test.py`.
